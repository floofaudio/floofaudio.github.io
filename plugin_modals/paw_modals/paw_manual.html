    <div>
        Paw Control is a VST instrument designed to creatively filter MIDI notes. Essentially it receives MIDI input,
        filters it, and outputs it again. While it does includes a sine synth as a reference sound, the real magic
        happens when you route Paw Control to your favorite MIDI instrument. Read on to find out what it does and how it
        works.

</div>
<div class="block">

    <div class="title is-5 mb-1">1. Note Selectors</div>
    <div>These 12 note selectors represent the 12 notes of an octave, allowing you to select which MIDI
        notes
        are active. A blue keycap indicates an active note, when you click it, it turns white indicating that it is
        inactive. The plugin highlights outputted keys in brown. The note selection
        applies to all octaves.</div>
</div>

<div class="block">
    <div class="title is-5 mb-1">2. Note Selection Nudgers</div>
    <div>These two buttons enable nudging all note selections one step to the left or right. With it you can
        do quick
        scale modulations. For instance, lets say you have selected active notes in the pattern of a C minor
        scale. If you nudge it to the right it then
        changes the scale to C# minor, and so forth.</div>
</div>

<div class="block">
    <div class="title is-5 mb-1">3. Saveslots</div>
    <div>These four buttons allow for quick switching between both note selectors and other controllers.
        The active saveslot is highlighted in white.
        Selections auto-save to the current slot when the key selection is changed.
        If you ctrl+click (or Command+click on Mac OS) on a saveslot, you copy the current selection to the saveslot you
        are
        clicking on.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="block">
    <div class="title is-5 mb-1">4. Random Range</div>
    <div>This slider adds the possibility of randomness to your output midi. The randomness is relative to the note paw
        control receives. The randomness is also confined within the current note-selection. Right-click the slider to
        include it in the current saveslot. This is indicated by a white background color. Use the chance knob under the
        slider to control the probability for this random event to occur.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="block">
    <div class="title is-5 mb-1">5. Octave Down Range</div>
    <div>This slider adds octave randomness to the outputted notes. The higher the
        slider, the lower the possible octaves. This is indicated by a white background color. Use the chance knob under
        the
        slider to control the probability for this random event to occur.</div>
</div>

<div class="block">
    <div class="title is-5 mb-1">6. Octave Up Range</div>
    <div>Similar to octave down range but sets randomness for octaves above the played note.Right-click the slider to
        include it in the current saveslot. This is indicated as applied when you see a a dot under the slider.
        This is indicated by a white background color. Use the chance knob under the
        slider to control the probability for this random event to occur.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="block">
    <div class="title is-5 mb-1">7. REC</div>
    <div>
        This button has two functions. <br><br>
        Normal click: Allows you to MIDI learn key selection. The keys are all deselected at first, and this
        mode is stopped by clicking again. You know the mode is active when the REC button is blinking.
        <br><br>
        CTRL+click (Command+click on Mac OS): Allows you to MIDI learn saveslots to MIDI notes. You know the mode is
        active when both
        the REC button and a saveslot button is blinking.
        Simply input a midi note and the next saveslot starts blinking. Afterwards you will be able to
        select saveslots with the midi notes you input.
        If you only want to assign some of the keys, simply abort the mode by clicking again on the REC
        button. If you want to delete all assignments, simply activate this mode and then press the REC
        button again before inputing any midi notes.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="block">
    <div class="title is-5 mb-1">8. Internal Sine Synth On/Off</div>
    <div>Toggles the internal sine synth on or off. Turning the synth off may slightly lower the overall
        latency.</div>
</div>

<div class="block">
    <div class="title is-5 mb-1">9. KM - Key Mode</div>
    <div>
        The key mode knob decides which direction Paw Control searches for an active note to replace it, when you play a note
        that is set to inactive. The choices are down, bi-directional and up.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="block">
    <div class="title is-5 mb-1">10. RM - Key Mode</div>
    <div>
        The random mode knob decides which direction Paw Control searches for an active note, when the random range slider
        is set above 0. The choices are down, bi-directional and up.
    </div>

    <div class="block">
        <div class="title is-5 mb-1">General installation notes</div>
        <div>Installation of this plugin is as simply as unzipping the zip file to uncover a folder with a .vst3 ending.
            Place this entire folder in a directory where your DAW host is able to locate it. An installer will replace this in the near future.
        </div>

        <div class="title is-5 mb-1 mt-3">Windows</div>
        <div>
            VST# plugins for Windows are typically installed in either "C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3" or
            "C:\Program Files\VSTPlugins". However, the exact location can vary depending on the configuration of your
            DAW host.
        </div>
        <div class="title is-5 mb-1 mt-3">Mac</div>
        <div>
            VST3 plugins on Mac OS are typically installed in /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3 or
            user//Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3. Place Paw Control in either of these folders and your DAW should be able
            to find it.
        </div>

    <div class="title is-4 mt-5">UPDATE GUIDE</div>
    <div>
        To update the plugin simply replace the old .vst3 folder with the new one.
        Be sure to only have one instance of the .vst3 folder in your plugin directory at any time!

    <div class="title is-4 mt-5">DAW ROUTING GUIDE</div>

    Paw Control is fun on its own but even more fun when you route the output of it to other
    instruments. Below, you will find guides for routing MIDI from Paw Control in various DAWs.

            Paw Control in both of them.
            Remember to also click the monitor "in" button on the receiving track so that it lights up blue.

        <div>
            Currently, Reason does not support internal MIDI routing, making it impossible to route
            Paw Control to another MIDI instrument within Reason. There might be workarounds with virtual midi busses,
            but that is outside the scope of
            this guide. We hope that the team at Reason will address this limitation in the future.
