            <div class="title is-5 mb-1">1. Key Selectors</div>
            <div>These 12 key selectors represent the 12 notes of an octave, allowing you to select which MIDI
                notes
                are active. A blue keycap indicates an active note; white indicates inactive. The selection
                applies to all octaves. The plugin highlights outputted keys in brown. If you press a note that is
                inactive, the nearest active note will be played instead.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div class="title is-5 mb-1">2. Key Selection Nudgers</div>
            <div>These two buttons enable nudging all key selections one step to the left or right. With it you can
                do quick
                scale modulations. For instance, lets say you have selected active keys in the pattern of a C minor
                scale. If you nudge it to the right it then
                changes the scale to C# minor, and so forth.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div class="title is-5 mb-1">3. Saveslots</div>
            <div>These four buttons allow for quick switching between different key selections.
                The active saveslot is highlighted in white.
                Selections auto-save to the current slot when the key selection is changed.
                If you ctrl+click on a saveslot, you copy the current selection to the saveslot you are
                clicking on.

            <div>This slider adds the possibility of randomness to your output midi. The randomness is confined
                within the range set and within the current key-selection.

            <div class="title is-5 mb-1">5. Octave Down Range</div>
            <div>This slider adds the possibility of randomness of octaves below the input note. The higher the
                slider the lower the octaves can go.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <div class="title is-5 mb-1">6. Octave Up Range</div>
            <div>Similar to octave down range but adds the possiblity of octaves above the input note instead.</div>

            <div class="title is-5 mb-1">7. REC</div>
            <div>
                This button has two functions. <br><br>
                Normal click: Allows you to MIDI learn key selection. The keys are all deselected at first, and this
                mode is stopped by clicking again. You know the mode is active when the REC button is blinking.
                <br><br>
                CTRL+click: Allows you to MIDI learn saveslots to MIDI notes. You know the mode is active when both
                the REC button and a saveslot button is blinking.
                Simply input a midi note and the next saveslot starts blinking. Afterwards you will be able to
                select saveslots with the midi notes you input.
                If you only want to assign some of the keys, simply abort the mode by clicking again on the REC
                button. If you want to delete all assignments, simply activate this mode and then press the REC
                button again before inputing any midi notes.
