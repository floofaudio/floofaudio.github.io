                    Paw Control is fun on its own but even more fun when you route the output of it to other
                    instruments.<br>
                    Below, you will find guides for routing MIDI from Paw Control to various DAWs.

                        <div>
                            Currently, Reason does not support internal MIDI routing, making it impossible to route
                            Paw Control to another MIDI instrument within Reason.
                            We hope that the team at Reason will address this limitation in the future.
                            There might be workarounds with virtual midi busses, but that is outside the scope of
                            this guide.

                            This plugin is currently not supported on Mac and as an AU plugin. We plan to add
                            support in the future once we have sufficient funds to acquire a Mac computer.
                            A guide for Logic will then quickly follow.
