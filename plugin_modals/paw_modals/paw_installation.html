                            in a directory
                            where your DAW host is able to locate it. An installer will replace this in the near future.

                            VST Plugins for windows are generally located in "C:\Program Files\Common Files\VstPlugins"
                            or
                            "C:\Program Files\VSTPlugins". However this is
                            dependable on the DAW host configuration.

                            This plugin is currently not supported on Mac as an AU plugin. We do plan to add support in
                            the future once we have sufficient funds to acquire a Mac computer.

                            If you are a Linux user, we are confident in your ability to figure this out, but the
                            general idea is the same as for windows.
