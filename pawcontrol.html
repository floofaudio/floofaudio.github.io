                <p>Paw Control is a VST instrument that lets you filter MIDI notes in creative ways.
                    It also includes a sine synth engine in so that you to hear the output right away.
                    The instrument is intended to be routed forward to any MIDI instrument of your choice. Read on for
                    the manual, installation guide and a guide for routing MIDI in various DAW's.

            <div class="block">
                <div class="title is-5 mb-1">1. Key Selectors</div>
                <div>These 12 key selectors represent the 12 notes of an octave, allowing you to select which MIDI
                    notes
                    are active. A blue keycap indicates an active note; white indicates inactive. The selection
                    applies to all octaves. The plugin highlights outputted keys in brown. If you press a note that is
                    inactive, the nearest active note will be played instead.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="block">
                <div class="title is-5 mb-1">2. Key Selection Nudgers</div>
                <div>These two buttons enable nudging all key selections one step to the left or right. With it you can
                    do quick
                    scale modulations. For instance, lets say you have selected active keys in the pattern of a C minor
                    scale. If you nudge it to the right it then
                    changes the scale to C# minor, and so forth.</div>

            <div class="block">
                <div class="title is-5 mb-1">3. Saveslots</div>
                <div>These four buttons allow for quick switching between different key selections.
                    The active saveslot is highlighted in white.
                    Selections auto-save to the current slot when the key selection is changed.
                    If you ctrl+click on a saveslot, you copy the current selection to the saveslot you are
                    clicking on.

                <div class="title is-5 mb-1">4. Random Range</div>
                <div>This slider adds the possibility of randomness to your output midi. The randomness is confined
                    within the range set and within the current key-selection.

            <div class="block">
                <div class="title is-5 mb-1">5. Octave Down Range</div>
                <div>This slider adds the possibility of randomness of octaves below the input note. The higher the
                    slider the lower the octaves can go.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="block">
                <div class="title is-5 mb-1">6. Octave Up Range</div>
                <div>Similar to octave down range but adds the possiblity of octaves above the input note instead.</div>

            <div class="block">
                <div class="title is-5 mb-1">7. REC</div>
                <div>
                    This button has two functions. <br><br>
                    Normal click: Allows you to MIDI learn key selection. The keys are all deselected at first, and this
                    mode is stopped by clicking again. You know the mode is active when the REC button is blinking.
                    <br><br>
                    CTRL+click: Allows you to MIDI learn saveslots to MIDI notes. You know the mode is active when both
                    the REC button and a saveslot button is blinking.
                    Simply input a midi note and the next saveslot starts blinking. Afterwards you will be able to
                    select saveslots with the midi notes you input.
                    If you only want to assign some of the keys, simply abort the mode by clicking again on the REC
                    button. If you want to delete all assignments, simply activate this mode and then press the REC
                    button again before inputing any midi notes.

            <div class="block">
                <div class="title is-5 mb-1">8. Internal Sine Synth On/Off</div>
                <div>Toggles the internal sine synth on or off. Turning the synth off may slightly lower the overall
                    latency.</div>

                                Currently, Reason does not support internal MIDI routing, making it impossible to route
                                Paw Control to another MIDI instrument within Reason.
                                We hope that the team at Reason will address this limitation in the future.
                                There might be workarounds with virtual midi busses, but that is outside the scope of
